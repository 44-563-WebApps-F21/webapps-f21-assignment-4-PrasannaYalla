           <P class="speech">The fact that they did not follow us at once into the house, as any one
            else would have done, seems to me to show that they have some sense of
            shame left.</P>

           <P class="speech">They have been eating muffins. That looks like repentance.</P>

            <h5 class="name CECILY"> CECILY. </h5>
            <p class="speech">Gwendolen, your common sense is invaluable. Mr. Moncrieff, kindly
            answer me the following question. Why did you pretend to be my
            guardian’s brother?</p>
            
            <h5 class="name ALGERNON"> ALGERNON. </h5>
            <p class="speech">In order that I might have an opportunity of meeting you.</p>

            <p class="stage_directions">[To Gwendolen.]</p>
            <p class="speech">That certainly seems a satisfactory explanation, does
            it not?</p>
            
            <h5 class="name GWENDOLEN"> GWENDOLEN. </h5>
            <p class="speech">Yes, dear, if you can believe him.</p>
            
            <h5 class="name CECILY"> CECILY. </h5>
            <p class="speech">I don’t. But that does not affect the wonderful beauty of his answer.
            
            <h5 class="name GWENDOLEN"> GWENDOLEN. </h5>
            <p class="speech">True. In matters of grave importance, style, not sincerity is the vital
            thing. Mr. Worthing, what explanation can you offer to me for
            pretending to have a brother? Was it in order that you might have an
            opportunity of coming up to town to see me as often as possible?
